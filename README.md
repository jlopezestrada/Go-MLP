# Go-MLP
Go-MLP is an open-source implementation of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) using the Go programming language. The MLP is a type of artificial neural network that is commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

## Perceptron
The perceptron was one of the earliest types of artificial neural networks and was developed in the 1950s. It can be used for binary classification tasks where the input data is linearly separable. With the advent of more advanced neural network architectures, the perceptron has been largely superseded, but it remains an important building block in neural network development.
